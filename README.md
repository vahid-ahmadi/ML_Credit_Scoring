This paper proposes novel unsupervised models based on DBSCAN clustering (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise). Besides the binary classification, our probabilistic approaches assign a default probability to each sample according to its distance from density-based clusters. More- over, our proposed profit based models could be applied in consensus credit scoring algorithms in which clustering has the role of helping to raise the accuracy of forecasting significantly. The performances of our innovative models on substantial data sets are comparable with other well- known state-of-the-art approaches
